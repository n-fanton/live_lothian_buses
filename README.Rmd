# An R Shiny app to display Lothian Buses info

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is still a work in progress. This app was developed as a result mostly of an excess of time. It fixes some of my main annoyances with the official apps: bus stops at the same location are grouped (rather than displayed as several A, B, C, etc. stops), and services to the Royal Infirmary are displayed as such, rather than going to the 'Royal Infirmry'. 

You can browse the app at [shinyapps.io](https://nfant.shinyapps.io/lothian_buses/).
